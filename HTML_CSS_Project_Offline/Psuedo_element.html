      Why is secret management important?<br> 
      Secrets management embeds security
      controls within the highest-risks layers of a modern organization's
      infrastructure, including cloud, code, data, and devices. Secrets
      management keeps all secrets safe, prevents secret sprawl, and ensures
      systems can connect instantly to accomplish automated tasks.
